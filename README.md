# SOC- so in this assignment I have made a basic todo Application backend server using express. 
In assignmentonlyjs file i have only done the given assignment using express.js.
In assignment1 I have tried to add some aesthetics using html and css which will be shown in the browser. The API endpoints for CRUD operations are prefixed with "/api" to keep them separate from the HTML serving.
We are locally saving the todos in an array so once we restart the server all the saved todos will be reset or deleted. So to solve this I made a todos.json file and save and fetch todos from it instead of locally saving it in an array.
